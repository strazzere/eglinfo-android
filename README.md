# eglinfo-android
like glxinfo but for egl, like eglinfo but specifically for Android

This is a tool ripped from the `mesa` library, which I had to slightly modify for Android use. Then 
I just wrapped it with an `Android.mk` that I pulled from one of my old projects... cause why not?

So if you're here, at this point, then you probably know what you're looking for at this point and
not much explanation should be needed for this repo!
